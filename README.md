EmployeeDirectory

This project enables a user to quickly and easily open a website and view employee directory information. Upon loading the page, the user will be presented with a mostly blank page that encourages them to select how many employees from a company they would like to view. Upon entering a number other than 0, a random user generator API will display however many employees the user opted to see. At this point, the user will be presented with neat, concise cards for each employee that displays a photo, first and last name, photo and email for each "employee". The user can then opt to sort the presented users alphabetically, or to narrow down their search by filtering the displayed employees by gender. The site was made with React, making its response time extremely efficient.
